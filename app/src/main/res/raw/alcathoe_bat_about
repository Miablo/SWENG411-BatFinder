The Alcathoe Bat is very similar to the Whiskered and Brandt's Bats. It was only confirmed as a separate species in Europe in 2001 after genetic analysis. It was then 'discovered' in the UK in 2010, but is thought to have been here much longer. All UK bats are nocturnal, feeding on midges, moths and other flying insects that they find in the dark by using echolocation. Little is known about the habits of this bat at present, but, like its close relatives, it is found in woodland and near water.
