Introduction
Pipistrelles are the commonest and most widespread of all British bat species. There are two
very similar species, common pipistrelle and soprano pipistrelle. Pipistrelles are the bats that
you are most likely to see. They appear fast and jerky in flight as they dodge about pursuing
small insects which the bats catch and eat on the wing. A single pipistrelle can consume up to
3,000 insects in one night!
