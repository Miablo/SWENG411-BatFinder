Introduction
The horseshoe bats can be distinguished from other British bats by the presence of a complex
horseshoe-shaped noseleaf which is related to their particular type of echolocation system.
When roosting they hang free with the wings more or less enfolding their body.
The greater horseshoe bat is one of our largest bat species, the size of a small pear.
